## ðŸ”’ Enforce SSL in Production
Ensure all communication is encrypted by forcing HTTPS on production environment.

In `config/environments/production.rb`:

```ruby
config.force_ssl = true
```

Also configure your web server (nginx, apache) for SSL termination. This protects data in transit from man-in-the-middle attacks.
