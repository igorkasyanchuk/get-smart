## 🔐 Enable CSRF Protection
Rails has built-in CSRF protection by default through authenticity tokens. Ensure that your controllers include `protect_from_forgery`.

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protect_from_forgery with: :exception
end
```

This protects your application from cross-site request forgery attacks by verifying the authenticity token on non-GET requests.
